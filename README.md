### Usage:
- To run the project, you need to add your configurations into the folder ```configs/``` as fround [here](https://github.com/hagerrady13/DQN-Pytorch/blob/master/configs/dqn_exp_0.json)
- ``` sh run.sh ```
- To run on a GPU, you need to enable cuda in the config file.


### Requirements:
- Pytorch: 0.4.0
- torchvision: 0.2.1
- tensorboardX: 0.8

Check [requirements.txt](https://github.com/hagerrady13/DQN-PyTorch/blob/master/requirements.txt).

### Future Work:
- Test DQN on a more complex environment such as MS-Pacman
